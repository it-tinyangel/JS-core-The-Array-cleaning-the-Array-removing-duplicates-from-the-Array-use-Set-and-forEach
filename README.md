# Array. Array cleaning. Removing duplicates from the array.

The `Set()` constructor, which automatically removes duplicates, the `forEach()` method to iterate over all elements of the array. The `toLowerCase()` method converts each element to lower case and the `add()` method adds them to the resulting object. The `Array.from()` method receives elements from the `Set` object. Thus, the function `removeDuplicates(arr)` returns an array that contains only the unique elements of the original array.
